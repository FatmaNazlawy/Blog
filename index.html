                       Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an 
                       intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to
                       complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development
                       commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development,
                       client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
